# Marbled Paper

Paper marbling is a printing technique for creating intricate patterns of colored ink. This is a mathematical simulation of the process similar to the approach researched by [Jaffer et al.](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jaffer/Marbling/)

## Tools

- **Drop** Click to add large or small dots of ink.
- **Comb** Click and drag to pull a comb through the ink in a straight line.
- **Spray** Click and hold to spray small dots everywhere.
- **Smudge** Click and drag to distort the whole canvas. This one isn't a real-life paper marbling tool, but a bug turned into a feature!

Several preset colors are available, but you can click on the current color to choose your own.
